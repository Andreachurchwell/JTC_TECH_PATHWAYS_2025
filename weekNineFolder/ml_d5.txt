# Weather Time Series Visualization Cheat Sheet

## 1. Basic Time Series Line Plot
- Purpose: Show overall trend and seasonal patterns over time.
- Tips:
  - Plot variable vs. time (e.g., temperature vs. date).
  - Use clear axis labels and grid.
  - Format x-axis with readable dates or months.
- Use when: You want to see trends and seasonality.

---

## 2. Multi-variable Subplots
- Purpose: Compare multiple weather variables side-by-side.
- Tips:
  - Share the x-axis (time).
  - Use distinct colors for each variable.
  - Label each subplot clearly.
- Use when: Comparing variables like temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

---

## 3. Monthly Boxplots
- Purpose: Show distribution and variability within each month.
- Tips:
  - Use month names on x-axis (Jan, Feb, etc.).
  - Visualize spread, median, and outliers.
- Use when: Highlighting seasonality and variability.

---

## 4. Dual-axis Plot
- Purpose: Show relationship between two related variables with different scales.
- Tips:
  - Use left y-axis for one variable and right y-axis for the other.
  - Use different colors for clarity.
- Use when: Comparing variables like temperature and precipitation.

---

## 5. Correlation Heatmap
- Purpose: Reveal strength of relationships between variables.
- Tips:
  - Use color gradients (e.g., coolwarm).
  - Annotate cells with correlation coefficients.
- Use when: Identifying strong/weak variable relationships.

---

## 6. Aggregated Monthly Statistics Plot
- Purpose: Show average, min, max monthly values with variability shading.
- Tips:
  - Plot monthly means with markers.
  - Shade area between min and max values.
- Use when: Illustrating seasonal cycles and ranges.

---

## 7. Rolling Statistics & Anomaly Detection
- Purpose: Identify unusual values compared to rolling mean and std deviation.
- Tips:
  - Calculate rolling mean and rolling std (e.g., 30-day window).
  - Highlight points beyond Â±2 standard deviations.
  - Show confidence intervals as shaded areas.
- Use when: Detecting anomalies or outliers.

---

## 8. Simulated Interactive Highlights
- Purpose: Emphasize specific data subsets like seasons.
- Tips:
  - Plot background data in muted colors.
  - Highlight selected periods (e.g., summer, winter) in bright colors.
- Use when: Drawing attention to important time periods.

---

## 9. Polar Plot for Seasonal Cycle
- Purpose: Display cyclical annual patterns in circular layout.
- Tips:
  - Map months to radians (angles).
  - Close the loop by repeating the first point.
  - Use markers and fill area for visual appeal.
- Use when: Visualizing repeating seasonal patterns.

# Additional Visualization Tips

- Use `matplotlib.dates` for date formatting (e.g., `DateFormatter`, `MonthLocator`).
- Choose consistent, meaningful colors (e.g., red = warm, blue = cold).
- Always label axes, add titles, legends.
- Use grids and `plt.tight_layout()` to improve readability.
- Smooth noisy data with rolling windows; pick appropriate window size.
- Visualize outliers clearly to understand data quality.
- For interactive exploration, try Plotly, Bokeh, or Matplotlib widgets.
