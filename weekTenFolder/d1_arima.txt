Quick ARIMA Study Plan for Tonight
Understand the basics — no heavy math:

ARIMA uses past data to predict the future by spotting patterns.

It’s like guessing tomorrow’s weather based on recent days — just way smarter and more flexible.

Don’t worry about the math right now; focus on the big idea and what the model output tells you.



ARIMA = AutoRegressive (AR) + Integrated (I) + Moving Average (MA)

It’s used to model time series data with trends and patterns.

The three key parameters: (p, d, q)

p: how many past points to look back (autoregression)

d: how many times to difference data to make it stationary

q: how many lagged forecast errors to include (moving average)

Walk through the steps of using ARIMA:

Check if data is stationary (plot it or use tests like ADF)

If not stationary, difference the data (d)

Decide on p and q (start simple, like p=1, q=1)

Fit the model on your training data

Use it to forecast future points

Evaluate your forecast accuracy (e.g., RMSE)

Practice with a simple example using real weather data

Use a small dataset (like average daily temperature for a month)

Run through fitting and predicting

Plot the results to see how it looks

Prepare for any quiz or questions

Know what p, d, and q mean

Be able to explain why differencing is used

Understand what kind of data ARIMA works best with (time series, stationary)

This class focuses on understanding time series data and forecasting using ARIMA models, seasonal decomposition, and model evaluation, equipping fellows to analyze and select appropriate models for temporal weather data.

Key Terms
ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model combining past values and errors
Stationarity: Property where statistical properties don't change over time
Differencing: Subtracting consecutive observations to achieve stationarity
Autocorrelation: Correlation of a time series with its own lagged values
Partial Autocorrelation: Correlation between observations at different lags, removing intermediate effects
Seasonal Decomposition: Separating time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
ACF Plot: Autocorrelation Function plot showing correlation at different lags
PACF Plot: Partial Autocorrelation Function plot for model order selection
AIC/BIC: Information criteria for model selection (lower is better)
Residual Analysis: Checking if model errors are random and normally distributed
