Overview
This class focuses on embedding trained ML models into Tkinter applications, creating responsive real-time prediction interfaces, and implementing asynchronous processing, model loading, and user-friendly design features like progress indicators.

Key Terms
Model Persistence: Saving trained models to disk for later use
Joblib: Efficient library for serializing scikit-learn models
Threading: Running code in parallel to keep GUI responsive
Callback Hell: Nested callbacks that make code hard to read
Asynchronous Processing: Non-blocking operations that run in background
Progress Bar: Widget showing completion status of long operations
Model Pipeline: Complete workflow from input to prediction
Thread-Safe: Code that works correctly when accessed by multiple threads
GUI Freezing: When interface becomes unresponsive during processing
Event Queue: Tkinter's mechanism for handling GUI updates
