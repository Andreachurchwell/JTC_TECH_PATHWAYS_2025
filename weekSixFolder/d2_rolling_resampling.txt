Overview
This class introduces key descriptive statistics—such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation—and teaches fellows how to apply them using Python to analyze data distributions, identify outliers, and support data-driven insights.

Key Terms
Time Series Resampling - The process of converting a time series from one frequency to another
Upsampling - Increasing the frequency of a time series (e.g., daily to hourly)
Downsampling - Decreasing the frequency of a time series (e.g., hourly to daily)
Aggregation Function - A function used to combine multiple values when downsampling (e.g., mean, sum, min, max)
Interpolation - Method used to estimate new values when upsampling (e.g., linear, cubic, spline)
Rolling Window - A fixed-size window that moves through a time series one step at a time
Window Size - The number of observations included in each rolling calculation
Moving Average - The average calculated over a rolling window of data points
Simple Moving Average (SMA) - A moving average where all observations in the window have equal weight
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) - A moving average where more recent observations have higher weights
Alpha (α) - The smoothing factor in EWMA that determines how quickly the weights decrease for older observations
Frequency Offset - String aliases used in pandas to specify time frequencies (e.g., 'D' for day, 'M' for month-end)
Trailing Window - A rolling window that includes the current observation and previous observations
Centered Window - A rolling window centered around the current observation with equal number of observations before and after
Volatility - A measure of variation or dispersion in a time series, often calculated using rolling standard deviation



🧠 1. Understand the Concepts Simply
Here’s a quick cheat sheet in your own words:

📊 Descriptive Stats:
Mean – average

Median – the middle value

Variance – how far numbers are from the mean

Standard Deviation – the average distance from the mean (square root of variance)

⏱️ Time Series Concepts:
Resampling – Changing how often you look at data (e.g., daily → weekly).

Upsampling – Increase frequency (add more rows, need to estimate values).

Downsampling – Reduce frequency (group values, need to aggregate).

Aggregation Function – How you combine values when downsampling (e.g., take the mean).

📐 Interpolation:
Used with upsampling to "fill in the blanks" using estimated values:

Linear: straight-line between known points.

Spline/Cubic: smoother curves between points.

🔁 Rolling Windows:
A way to look at a small chunk (window) of the data at a time.

Window Size – How many data points are in the window (e.g., 3 days).

Moving Average – The average of each window’s values.

Simple Moving Average (SMA) – All values are weighted equally.

EWMA – More recent data has more weight.

Controlled by alpha (α) – closer to 1 means recent values matter more.

🧭 Types of Windows:
Trailing Window – Looks only at current and past values.

Centered Window – Includes values before and after current one.

📈 Volatility:
A measure of how much values change (standard deviation over time)
