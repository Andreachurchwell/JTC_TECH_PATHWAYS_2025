# ðŸ“š Overview
# Focus is on organizing code effectively for the Weather Project.

# Emphasizes logical thinking, maintainable structure, and refactoring skills.

# Goal: make your project easy to read, update, and expand.

# ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
# Code Structure
# How your code is divided across files and folders for clarity and efficiency.

# Refactoring
# Cleaning up and reorganizing code without changing what it does.

# Separation of Concerns
# Each file or function should have one jobâ€”makes it easier to manage.

# Module
# A Python file that holds reusable code you can import elsewhere.

# Import
# Brings code from one module into another so you donâ€™t repeat yourself.

# Maintainability
# How simple it is to read, fix, or build on your code later.
