# A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Think of it as a mold for making things like dogs,
#  cats, or cars, each with their own properties and actions.
# It bundles data (variables) and functions (called methods) that operate on that data together.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"
