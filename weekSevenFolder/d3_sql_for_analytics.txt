COUNT() - A function that returns the number of rows that match a specified criterion
SUM() - A function that calculates the total sum of a numeric column
AVG() - A function that calculates the average value of a numeric column
MIN() - A function that returns the smallest value of the selected column
MAX() - A function that returns the largest value of the selected column
Window Function - A function that performs a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row
Analytical Query - A SQL query designed to analyze data rather than simply retrieve it
Time-Series Analysis - Analysis of data points collected over time to identify trends
Aggregate - A summary value calculated from multiple rows

NULL Handling - The way SQL treats NULL values in aggregation functions


✅ 1. Review the Key SQL Clauses and Functions
Make sure you understand the purpose and basic syntax of each:

Concept	                                             What to Know
COUNT(*), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()	             These operate on columns across rows (can be grouped).
GROUP BY	                                         Used to group rows by one or more columns.
HAVING vs WHERE	                                     WHERE filters before aggregation, HAVING filters after.
DISTINCT	                                         Filters out duplicate values—try combining with COUNT(DISTINCT col).
NULL Handling	                                     Aggregates usually ignore NULL (e.g., AVG() skips NULLs).
