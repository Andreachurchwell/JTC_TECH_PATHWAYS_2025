Linear Search: A simple search method that checks each element in a list one by one until the target is found or the end is reached.

Binary Search: A fast search algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and comparing the middle element to the target.

Search Space: The set of elements being searched through to find a specific target.

Target Element: The specific item you’re looking for within a list or collection.

Mid-Point: The middle index or element used in Binary Search to divide the list into halves.

Comparison Function: A function that compares two values and helps determine if they are equal, or which one is greater or smaller.

Time Complexity: Describes how the time required by an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

Space Complexity: Describes how much memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases.

Iterative Implementation: A version of an algorithm that uses loops (like for or while) to repeat operations.

Recursive Implementation: A version of an algorithm where a function repeatedly calls itself with a smaller part of the input until a base condition is met.


🔍 When to Use Linear Search
✅ The list is unsorted.

✅ The list is small, so performance isn’t a big concern.

✅ You want simple logic without worrying about sorting.

✅ You may need to search in real-time as data is received (e.g. streaming input).

Time Complexity:

Best case: O(1) (if target is the first element)

Worst/average case: O(n), where n is the number of elements

Space Complexity:

O(1) – no extra memory is needed



🔍 When to Use Binary Search
✅ The list is already sorted (very important!).

✅ You need fast lookups on large datasets.

❌ Do not use it if the data is unsorted or changes frequently without re-sorting.

Time Complexity:

Best case: O(1) (if the mid-point is the target)

Worst/average case: O(log n), where n is the number of elements

Space Complexity:

O(1) for iterative

O(log n) for recursive due to call stack

| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Requires Sorted List | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes           |
| Speed on Large Lists | 🐢 Slower     | ⚡ Faster        |
| Logic Simplicity     | ✅ Easy        | ❌ More Complex  |
| Time Complexity      | O(n)          | O(log n)        |
| Space Complexity     | O(1)          | O(1) / O(log n) |


🔍 1. Finding Specific Data in Large Collections
Example: You have a database of 10,000 customer records, and you need to find everyone named "Andrea."

Without search: you'd manually check every record.

With search: type "Andrea" and instantly get matches.

🔍 2. Searching Text in Documents or Websites
Example: A user wants to find all blog posts that mention "Python."

Websites (like blogs or forums) need a search feature so users can quickly access relevant content.

🔍 3. Filtering Through User Input or Product Lists
Example: An e-commerce site lets users type "red shoes" to see only red shoes.

Search helps users avoid browsing hundreds of items manually.

🔍 4. Searching Code or Logs
Example: Developers use search to:

Find a specific function in a big codebase.

Locate an error message in 1,000 lines of log output.

🔍 5. Real-Time Suggestions (Autocomplete)
Example: As you type in Google, results appear instantly.

This uses a search algorithm under the hood
